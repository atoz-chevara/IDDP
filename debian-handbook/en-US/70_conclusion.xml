  <title>Conclusion: Debian's Future</title>
  <highlights>
    <para>The story of Falcot Corp ends with this last chapter; but Debian
    lives on, and the future will certainly bring many interesting
    surprises.</para>

    <title>Upcoming Developments</title>

    <para>Weeks (or months) before a new version of Debian is released, the
    Release Manager picks the codename for the next version. Now that
    Debian version 6.0 is out, the developers are already busy working on
    the next version, codenamed <emphasis
    role="distribution">Wheezy</emphasis>…</para>

    <para>There's no official list of planned changes, and Debian never
    makes promises relating to technical goals of the coming versions.
    However, a few development trends can already be noted, and there are
    many reasons to believe they will turn into concrete results in the new
    version.</para>

    <para>The package management system will be able to install packages
    for several different architectures on the same system (this is known
    as “multi-arch support”). This will allow installing 32 bit
    applications on a 64 bit system, and vice-versa. Another project worth
    mentioning is <emphasis>Constantly Usable Testing</emphasis>, which
    aims at labeling <emphasis role="distribution">Testing</emphasis> as an
    officially supported distribution that can be recommended to the
    general public. The default “init” process
    (<command>sysvinit</command>) may also be replaced by more modern
    systems such as <command>upstart</command> or
    <command>systemd</command>.</para>

    <para>Of course, all the main software suites will have had a major
    release. For instance, <emphasis role="distribution">Wheezy</emphasis>
    will include a 3.x version of GNOME, which brings a deep and promising
    change in the usual graphical desktop paradigm.</para>

    <title>Debian's Future</title>

    <para>In addition to these internal developments, one can reasonably
    expect new Debian-based distributions to come to light, thanks to the
    growing popularity of <emphasis>debian-installer</emphasis> and its
    flexibility. New specialized subprojects will also be started, in order
    to widen Debian's reach to new horizons.</para>

    <para>The Debian user community will increase, and new contributors
    will join the project… including, maybe, you!</para>

    <para>The Debian project is stronger than ever, and well on its way
    towards its goal of a universal distribution; the inside joke within
    the Debian community is about <foreignphrase>World
    Domination</foreignphrase>.</para>

    <para>In spite of its old age and its respectable size, Debian keeps on
    growing in all kinds of (sometimes unexpected) directions. Contributors
    are teeming with ideas, and discussions on development mailing lists,
    even when they look like bickerings, keep increasing the momentum.
    Debian is sometimes compared to a black hole, of such density that any
    new free software project is attracted.</para>

    <para>Beyond the apparent satisfaction of most Debian users, a deep
    trend is becoming more and more indisputable: people are increasingly
    realising that collaborating, rather than doing business solo, leads to
    better results for everyone. Such is the rationale used by
    distributions merging into Debian by way of subprojects.</para>

    <para>The Debian project is therefore not threatened by
    extinction…</para>

    <title>Future of this Book</title>

    <para>We would like this book to evolve in the spirit of free software.
    We therefore welcome contributions, remarks, suggestions, and
    criticism. Please direct them to Raphaël
    (<email>hertzog@debian.org</email>) or Roland
    (<email>lolando@debian.org</email>). The website will be used to gather
    all information relevant to its evolution. <ulink type="block"
    url="http://debian-handbook.info/"/></para>

    <para>We tried to integrate most of what our experience at Debian
    taught us, so that anyone can use this distribution and take the best
    advantage of it as soon as possible. We hope this book contributes to
    making Debian less confusing and more popular, and we welcome publicity
    around it!</para>

    <para>We'd like to conclude on a personal note. Writing (and
    translating) this book took a considerable amount of time out of our
    usual professional activity. Since we're both freelance consultants,
    any new source of income grants us the freedom to spend more time
    improving Debian; we hope this book to be successful and to contribute
    to this. In the meantime, feel free to retain our services! <ulink
