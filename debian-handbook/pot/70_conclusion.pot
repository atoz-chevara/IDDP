msgid "There's no official list of planned changes, and Debian never makes promises relating to technical goals of the coming versions. However, a few development trends can already be noted, and there are many reasons to believe they will turn into concrete results in the new version."

msgid "The package management system will be able to install packages for several different architectures on the same system (this is known as “multi-arch support”). This will allow installing 32 bit applications on a 64 bit system, and vice-versa. Another project worth mentioning is <emphasis>Constantly Usable Testing</emphasis>, which aims at labeling <emphasis role=\"distribution\">Testing</emphasis> as an officially supported distribution that can be recommended to the general public. The default “init” process (<command>sysvinit</command>) may also be replaced by more modern systems such as <command>upstart</command> or <command>systemd</command>."

msgid "In spite of its old age and its respectable size, Debian keeps on growing in all kinds of (sometimes unexpected) directions. Contributors are teeming with ideas, and discussions on development mailing lists, even when they look like bickerings, keep increasing the momentum. Debian is sometimes compared to a black hole, of such density that any new free software project is attracted."

msgid "Beyond the apparent satisfaction of most Debian users, a deep trend is becoming more and more indisputable: people are increasingly realising that collaborating, rather than doing business solo, leads to better results for everyone. Such is the rationale used by distributions merging into Debian by way of subprojects."

Since we're both freelance consultants, any new source of income grants us the freedom to spend more time improving Debian; we hope this book to be successful and to contribute to this.
